json-serializer
===============

The purpose of this library is to have a generic object serialization tool that is JSON compatible (by default).
Apart from `JSON.stringify(object)` compatible `json.serialize(object)` function, `json.serialize` can be passed with config options `json.serialize(object, config)`, which properties can be described:

 * `exclude=undefined` Array of object references to be excluded during process, `===` check.
 * `renderFunction=undefined` custom renderer function, must return string,
     any other value will be ignored.
 * `excludeInstances=undefined` Array of instances that will be exclude from object tree elements (instanceof check)
 * `level=undefined` Level number (>=1) that serializer should not go below
 * `excludeTypes=undefined` Array of types that will be exclude from object tree elements (typeof check)
 * `excludeNames=undefined` Array of property names that will be exclude from object tree elements
 * `excludeMatches=undefined` Array of regex objects that will be cause objects properties exclude if they match any of regex in the array.
 * `own=undefined` If use hasOwnProperty should be used while checking if object property will be added
 * `excludeOnTrue=undefined` function reference that will be used to decide which elements will be included
 * `dateAsString=true` How date will be returned
 * `raw = false` dont use "json" standard output and serialize real values (undefines, dates as numbers etc)
 * `includeFunctions=false` if functions will be ignored or not, if not, they will be treated like objects
 * `fakeFunctions = false` if includeFunctions is used, this options tell to return blank function instead of traversing it as object
 * `realFunctions = false` if includeFunctions is used, functions will be returned as their "toString()" values
 * `prettyPrint=false` return output "prettyfied", it does not prettify functions contents.

By default json.serialize(object) will output normal JSON, same as known JSON.stringify.

`json` have following features:

* does not pollute Object.prototype - it is simple static function
* implementation is very minimal and kept simple (feel free to commit to work)
* delivers function `json.parse` which is a similar method to `JSON.parse`, with a simpler regex used.
